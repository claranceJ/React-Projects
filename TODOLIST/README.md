This is a React Todo List application built using React, CSS and Vite.

Features:

    Add new todo items.
    Edist listed Todo Items
    Delete individual todo items.
    Persist data in local storage (your todos are saved even after refreshing the page).

Technologies:

    Frontend: React, Vite
    Styling: CSS
    Data Persistence: Local Storage
    React Concepts: Hooks, Props

Challenges Faced:

    Maintaining State: Managing the state of the todo list items effectively. This was overcome by utilizing React Hooks like useState and useEffect.
    Data Persistence: Ensuring todos persist even after page refresh. Local Storage was implemented for this purpose.
    Separation of Concerns: Breaking down the application into well-defined components with clear responsibilities using Props.
